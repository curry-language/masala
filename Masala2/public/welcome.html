<h5>General</h5>
<p>
<b>Masala</b> is a web-based system to upload and publish
software packages written
in the declarative multi-paradigm language
<a href="http://www.curry-lang.org" target="_blank">Curry</a>.
The <a href="https://cpm.curry-lang.org" target="_blank">packages</a>
uploaded to Masala can easily be downloaded and installed
with the
<a href="http://www.curry-lang.org/tools/cpm" target="_blank">Curry Package Manager (CPM)</a>
on a local machine.
</p>

<h5>Uploading packages</h5>
<p>
Before uploading a new package or a new version of an existing package,
one has to register and then log in (see the buttons/links
in the top-right corner).
When you upload a new package, you are the maintainer of this package.
Later, you can also invite other registered users as maintainers
of your package. Note that only maintainers of a package
can upload new versions of the same package.
</p>
<p>
Note that package specifications require one or more categories
to which they belong. When uploading a package, the specified
categories must exist in the
<a href="?Category/list">current list of categories</a>.
If you want to add a new category to Masala,
please contact the system administrator.
</p>

<h5>Publishing packages</h5>
<p>
Packages or package versions are not immediately visible to other users.
In order to make a package visible, you must either be a trusted user
(ask the Masala administrator to make you a trusted user)
or inform the Masala administrator to publish your package.
This is necessary to avoid the publication of useless packages.
The administrator can be contacted inside Masala if you are logged in
(see the right-top user menu when you are logged in).
</p>
<p>
When a package has been published,
it is visible in Masala and ready for downloading,
but it might require some time to appear in the
<a href="https://cpm.curry-lang.org" target="_blank">general list of Curry packages</a>
which is nightly generated.
</p>

<h5>Registration</h5>
<p>
You can freely register to Masala.
This is necessary to upload new packages or watch the activity
of other packages.
To register, use the "Login/Register" menu in the top-right corner.
For the registration, you need a valid email address which
is used to verify your account, sending lost passwords, etc.
This email address is not shown to other users of Masala.
You must also choose a public name which is shown with your published
package.
Later you can also decide to add a public email address to your profile.
In this case, this email address is shown to other users if they
want to contact you.
</p>

<h5>Development</h5>
<p>
Masala has been developed by the
<a href="https://www.ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/" target="_blank">Programming Languages and Compiler Construction Group</a>
at the <a href="https://www.uni-kiel.de/" target="_blank">Kiel University</a>.
Suggestions to improve the system are welcome!
