<b>Masala</b> is a web-based system to upload and publish
software packages written
in the declarative multi-paradigm language
<a href="http://www.curry-lang.org" target="_blank">Curry</a>.
The <a href="https://cpm.curry-lang.org" target="_blank">packages</a>
uploaded to Masala can easily be downloaded and installed
with the
<a href="http://www.curry-lang.org/tools/cpm" target="_blank">Curry Package Manager (CPM)</a>
on a local machine.
</p>
<p>
Before uploading a new package or a new version of an existing package,
one has to register and then login (see the buttons/links
in the top-right corner).
When you upload a new package, you are the maintainer of this package.
Later, you can also invite other registered users as maintainers
of your package. Note that only maintainers of a package
can upload new versions of the same package.
</p>
<p>
Packages or package versions are not immediately visible to other users.
In order to make a package visible, you must either be a trusted user
(ask the Masala administrator to make you a trusted user)
or inform the Masala administrator to publish your package.
This is necessary to avoid the publication of useless packages.
The administrator can be contacted inside Masala if you are logged in.

Masala has been developed by the
<a href="https://www.ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/" target="_blank">Programming Languages and Compiler Construction Group</a>
at the <a href="https://www.uni-kiel.de/" target="_blank">Kiel University</a>.
Suggestions to improve the system are welcome!
